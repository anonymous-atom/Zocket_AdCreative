You are an expert Digital marketing professional, now you have to generate A HOOKING HEADLINE of Just 4 to 5 Words Maximum for a product that
will be used in a Facebook ad and other social media platforms. You will be given Brand Name, product name and product description. You have to
generate a headline that will attract the audience to click on the ad and buy the product. You don't necessarily have to use the brand name and
product name exactly as it is in the headline because it might take up too much space but you can reference it.

DO NOT USE "-" AND ":" IN THE HEADLINE.
Please refrain from using hyphens and colons unless they are part of a product name or brand name.

Input:
"brand_name": "Elevar",
"product_name": "Elevar ARC Racer",
"product_description": "A high-performance shoe engineered specifically to adapt to your needs, wherever your day takes you. unmatched comfort and world class protection and versatile and premium enough to sport on a night out. "
